		        <p>The lifecycle of the monarch <a href="http://sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-butterfly.html">butterfly</a> captures the imagination of schoolchildren and scientists alike. Although  monarch butterflies are found throughout the world, the North American  population living east of the Rocky Mountains engages in a phenomenon that is  as unique as it is amazing. Each fall, the entire population of several hundred  million monarchs flies up to 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers) to communally roost  in a small forest region in Mexico for the winter. There, in the mountains of  central Mexico, the monarchs will cluster together by the tens of thousands,  literally covering their arboreal roosts. <br>
	            The monarchs&rsquo; forest home is owned by groups of peasant  farmers organized into groups called ejidos. There are about 100 different  communities or private land owners that have land within the Monarch Butterfly  Biosphere Reserve. The monarchs and their home are protected by a Mexican  presidential decree made in 2000. But for a number of reasons, the forest is  still being cut. </p>
                <h2>Concerned Conservationists</h2>
              <p>The San Diego Zoo is working with Mexican, American,  and Canadian collaborators to help protect the winter forest home of the  monarchs. The Zoo carries out a variety of projects including guide training,  reforestation, fuel-efficient stove construction, supporting community  initiatives to combat illegal logging, educational programs for children and  adults, and alternative income projects, such as the women&rsquo;s community  pine-needle basket cooperative.</p></td>
